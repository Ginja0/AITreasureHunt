# AITreasureHunt


In this project I construct a code that plays a treasure hunt game that uses AI to find the treasure. This was done through reinforcment learning adjusting the reward values to optimize the path.
Computer scientists discover and use AI. They use algorithms to make machine learning better and more efficient. This helps because machine learning can experiment in much less time than humans can. This allows the machine to make experiments and decisions that could take years off. 
I aproached this problem as a computer scientist by allowing the machine to explore and use greed to find the most optimal path. 
The ethical responsabilities of a computer scientist is to ensure that the data being used does not violate user's privacy.
